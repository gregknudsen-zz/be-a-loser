            <p>
               After my own struggles with weight gain and obesity, as well as pre diabetic blood labs I knew I had to make a change. The standard methods for weight loss, ie. Eat Less, Move More, just weren't working. I wasn't happy with the direction my doctor and mainstream medical and nutritional experts were taking me. So I decided to take matters in my own hands. I discovered the writings of <a href="https://twitter.com/garytaubes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Gary Taubes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/drjasonfung">Dr. Jason Fung</a> and my quality of life improved immensely. This change was so profound, and after much intense study, so obvious and logical, that I felt I needed to share it with as many people as I could. I felt that YouTube was the best forum to reach as many people as I could as quickly as possible. <br>
